    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <h5>Programming Experience</h5>
        <p class="info">I began programming in the winter of 2016 when I started a class at Epicodus.  While there are a lot of resources and ways to learn programming online, Epicodus pushes me to dedicate time to studying each week and makes a normally very solitary task more social. When I finish this class, I plan on continuing my education - my next goal will be to learn Python and enroll in a Master's degree program for Data Science.</p>
